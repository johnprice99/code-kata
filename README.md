=========

A group of Coding Kata that I have worked on from a TDD perspective:

[Roman Numerals](classes/RomanNumerals.php) - A small class to convert a string of roman numerals into digits (Tests: tests/RomanNumeralsTest.php)

[OCR](classes/OCR.php) - A class to read in a file of ASCII numbers and return them in digits

[FizzBuzz](classes/FizzBuzz.php) - Simple FizzBuzz kata
